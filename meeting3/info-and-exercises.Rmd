### Chapter 5 Exercises

Whenever flights are referred to, use the `nycflights13::flights` data to answer the question. 

#### Section 5.2.4 # 1 (odd-numbered sub-parts only), # 2 - 4

1.  Find all flights that

    a.  Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
    b.  ~~Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)~~
    c.  Were operated by United, American, or Delta
    d.  ~~Departed in summer (July, August, and September)~~
    e.  Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
    f.  ~~Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight~~
    g.  Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

> Solution:

```{r}
# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
# Were operated by United, American, or Delta
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
# Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
```

2.  Sort `flights` to find the flights with longest departure delays.
    Find the flights that left earliest.

> Solution:

```{r}

```


3.  Sort `flights` to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.
    (Hint: try sorting by a calculation).

> Solution:

```{r}

```

4.  Which flights travelled the farthest?
    Which travelled the shortest?

> Solution:

```{r}
# Which flights travelled the farthest?
# Which travelled the shortest?
```

#### Section 5.3.1 # 1, 3, 4
 
1. How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use is.na()).

> Solution:

```{r}

```

3. Sort flights to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.

> Solution:

```{r}

```

4. Which flights travelled the farthest? Which travelled the shortest?

> Solution:

```{r}

```
#### Section 5.4.1 # 1 - 4

1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.

> Solution:

```{r}

```

2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

3. What does the any_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```r
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```

> Solution:

```{r}

```

4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

```r
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```
> Solution:

```{r}

```

#### Section 5.5.2 # 1, 3, 5

1. Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

> Solution:

```{r}

```

3. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

5. What does 1:3 + 1:10 return? Why?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

#### Section 5.6.7 # 2 - 6

2. Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as `not_cancelled %>% count(dest)` and `not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)` (without using `count()`).

> Solution:

```{r}

```

3. Our definition of cancelled flights (`is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay)` ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

4. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

5. Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about `flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n())`)

> Solution:

```{r}

```

6. What does the `sort` argument to `count()` do. When might you use it?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

#### Section 5.7.1 # 2, 4, 6, 8

2. Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

4. For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

> Solution:

```{r}

```

6. Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

8. For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.

> Solution:

```{r}

```

### Chapter 7 Exercises 

Unless otherwise noted, answer the questions using the `diamonds` data.

#### Section 7.3.4 # 2 - 4

2. Explore the distribution of `price`. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the `binwidth` and make sure you try a wide range of values.)

> Solution:

```{r}

```

3. How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

4. Compare and contrast `coord_cartesian()` vs `xlim()` or `ylim()` when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

#### Section 7.4.1 # 1, 2

1. What happens to missing values in a histogram? What happens to missing values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

2. What does `na.rm = TRUE` do in `mean()` and `sum()`?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

#### Section 7.5. Do the first 2 problems of each section 7.5.1.1, 7.5.2.1, and 7.5.3.1

##### Section 7.5.1.1

1. Use what you’ve learned to improve the visualisation of the departure times of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights.

> Solution:

```{r}

```

2. What variable in the diamonds dataset is most important for predicting the price of a diamond? How is that variable correlated with cut? Why does the combination of those two relationships lead to lower quality diamonds being more expensive?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

##### Section 7.5.2.1

1. How could you rescale the count dataset above to more clearly show the distribution of cut within colour, or colour within cut?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

2. Use `geom_tile()` together with dplyr to explore how average flight delays vary by destination and month of year. What makes the plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

##### Sedtion 7.5.3.1

1. Instead of summarising the conditional distribution with a boxplot, you could use a frequency polygon. What do you need to consider when using `cut_width()` vs `cut_number()`? How does that impact a visualisation of the 2d distribution of `carat` and `price`?

> Solution:

```{r}

```

2. Visualise the distribution of carat, partitioned by price.

> Solution:

```{r}

```
