### Chapter 5 Exercises

Whenever flights are referred to, use the `nycflights13::flights` data to answer the question. 

#### Section 5.2.4 # 1 (odd-numbered sub-parts only), # 2 - 4

1.  Find all flights that

    a.  Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
    b.  ~~Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)~~
    c.  Were operated by United, American, or Delta
    d.  ~~Departed in summer (July, August, and September)~~
    e.  Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
    f.  ~~Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight~~
    g.  Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# first load the data: 
data("flights", package = "nycflights13")

# read the data documentation:
# ?nycflights13::flights

# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >= 120) %>% 
  glimpse()

# Were operated by United, American, or Delta
# see ?nycflights13::airlines
data("airlines", package = "nycflights13")

# advanced solution to get airline codes
airlines %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(name, "United|American|Delta")) %>% 
  pull(carrier) -> uad

# or, simply view the data and find the codes
# View(airlines)
# uad <- c("AA", "DL", "UA")

flights %>% 
  filter(carrier %in% uad) %>% 
  glimpse()

# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0) %>% 
  glimpse() 

# Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

flights %>% 
  filter(dep_time == 2400 | (dep_time >=1 & dep_time <= 600)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    
2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(between(hour, 1, 3))

between(pi, 3, 4)
```


> Sam's Solution: 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(dep_time == 2400 | between(dep_time, 1, 600)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```


3. How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

> Live Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  count()

# what others variables have missing values 
summary(flights)

# simina's solution
sapply(flights, function(x){
  sum(is.na(x))
  }
)

# what do the missing rows represent?? 
# cancelled flights
```


> Sam's Solution: 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```


4. Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing? Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)

> Sam's Solution: 

```{r}
# anything to power of 0 is always 1.
NA ^ 0

# anything or TRUE is always true, so TRUE
NA | TRUE

# intersection of false with anything is false
FALSE & NA

# NA could be Inf or -Inf which are undefined (NaN), so the NA is propogated
NA * 0
```


#### Section 5.3.1 # 1, 3, 4
 
1. How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na()`).

> Live Solution: 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(!is.na(dep_time))

flights %>% 
  arrange(desc(is.na(dep_time)))
```


> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(!is.na(air_time))
```

3. Sort flights to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(distance / air_time) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

4. Which flights travelled the farthest? Which travelled the shortest?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# Which flights travelled the farthest?
flights %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance)) %>% 
  glimpse()

# Which travelled the shortest?
flights %>% 
  arrange(distance) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

#### Section 5.4.1 # 1 - 4

1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
my_vars <- c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
flights %>% 
  select(my_vars) %>% 
  head()

flights %>% 
  select(4, 6, 7, 9) %>% 
  head()


flights %>% 
  select(contains("_time"), contains("_delay"), -contains("sched"), -contains("air")) %>% 
  head()


flights %>% 
  select(matches("^dep_|^arr_")) %>% 
  head()
```

2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(arr_time, arr_delay, dep_delay, arr_time) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

3. What does the `any_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```{r}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```

> Live Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(any_of(vars))

flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, dep_delay, arr_delay)

flights %>% 
  select(vars)
```



```{r}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# ?any_of

flights %>% 
  select(any_of(vars))
```

4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

```r
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```
> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# ?contains
select(flights, contains("TIME"))

select(flights, contains("TIME", ignore.case = F))
```

#### Section 5.5.2 # 1, 3, 5

1. Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

> Live Solution: 

```{r}
# 1. write a fn that takes HHMM numbers and converts them to minutes since midnight 

convert_minutes <- function(tm){
  
  hr <- tm %/% 100 # hour
  mins <- tm %% 100
  
  msm <- hr * 60 + mins
  
  if (msm == 1440){
    msm <- 0
  } 
  
  return(msm)
}



flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_time = convert_minutes(dep_time), 
         sched_dep_time = convert_minutes(sched_dep_time)) -> flights
```


> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(contains("dep_time")) %>% 
  head()

# function to convert time in hhmm form to number of minutes since midnight.
convert_time <- function(hhmm){
  hours = hhmm %/% 100 # integer division
  minutes = hhmm %% 100 # modulo
  
  hours * 60 + minutes
}

flights <- flights %>% 
  mutate(across(contains("dep_time"), convert_time))

flights %>% 
  select(contains("dep_time"))
```

3. Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, and `dep_delay`. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

> Live Solution: 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay) %>% 
  mutate(dep_delay2 = dep_time - sched_dep_time)
```


> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# these are now the new versions of dep_time and sched_dep_time 
flights %>% 
  select(contains("dep")) %>% 
  glimpse()

flights %>% 
  select(contains("dep")) %>% 
  mutate(computed_dep_delay = dep_time - sched_dep_time) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

5. What does 1:3 + 1:10 return? Why?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
1:3 + 1:10
```

#### Section 5.6.7 # 2 - 6

2. Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as `not_cancelled %>% count(dest)` and `not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)` (without using `count()`).

> Live Solution: 

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  count(dest)

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

not_cancelled %>% 
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarize(total_distance = sum(distance, na.rm = TRUE))
```


> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# not cancelled data created in section 5.6.2
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

# output 1 
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(dest) %>% 
  glimpse()

# alternate method 
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  glimpse()

# output 2
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(tailnum, wt = distance) %>% 
  glimpse()

# alternate method 
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(distance)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

3. Our definition of cancelled flights (`is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay)` ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# one solution: if a flight has a scheduled departure time (all do) but the 
# actual departure time is missing, it was cancelled 
flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

4. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

```{r}
cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))

cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year, month, day)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = n ))

flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(cancel = sum(is.na(dep_delay)),
            mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(cancel <= 200) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cancel, mean_delay)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate(is_cancelled = is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarize(n_cancelled = sum(is_cancelled), 
            n_flights = n(),
            prop_cancelled = n_cancelled / n_flights, 
            avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE) ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(prop_cancelled)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_dep_delay, y= prop_cancelled)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

5. Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about `flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n())`)

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>% 
  left_join(airlines)

data("airports", package = "nycflights13")
airports <- airports %>% select(faa, name, tzone)

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>% 
  left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))

flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier, dest) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>% 
  left_join(airlines) %>% 
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"), suffix = c("_carrier", "_dest") ) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

6. What does the `sort` argument to `count()` do. When might you use it?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(dest, sort = T)
```

#### Section 5.7.1 # 2, 4, 6, 8

2. Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay)) %>% 
  slice(1)
```

4. For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

> Live Solution: 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  mutate(total_min_delay = sum(arr_delay),
         prop_delay = arr_delay / total_min_delay
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(prop_delay))
```


> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  mutate(total_arr_delay = sum(arr_delay),
         prop_tot_delay = arr_delay / total_arr_delay) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_tot_delay))
  
```

6. Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(air_time)

flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_time)) %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  mutate(shortest_flight_airtime = air_time[which.min(distance)], 
         at_over_shortest_at = air_time / shortest_flight_airtime) %>% 
  arrange(at_over_shortest_at) %>% 
  select(origin, dest, air_time, shortest_flight_airtime, at_over_shortest_at) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

8. For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of greater than 1 hour.

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  mutate(cumulative_hr_delays = cumsum(dep_delay > 60)) %>% 
  filter(cumulative_hr_delays < 1) %>% 
  count(sort = T)
```

### Chapter 7 Exercises 

Unless otherwise noted, answer the questions using the `diamonds` data.

#### Section 7.3.4 # 2 - 4

2. Explore the distribution of `price`. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the `binwidth` and make sure you try a wide range of values.)

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = price))
```

3. How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat == .99) %>% 
  count()

diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat == 1) %>% 
  count()
```

4. Compare and contrast `coord_cartesian()` vs `xlim()` or `ylim()` when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = .1)

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = .1) + 
  xlim(c(0,1))

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = .1) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1))

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = .1) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 1.95))
```

#### Section 7.4.1 # 1, 2

1. What happens to missing values in a histogram? What happens to missing values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights ) + 
  geom_histogram(aes( x= dep_delay), binwidth = 10)

qplot(x = c("red", "red", "blue", NA), geom = "bar")
```

2. What does `na.rm = TRUE` do in `mean()` and `sum()`?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}

```

#### Section 7.5. Do the first 2 problems of each section 7.5.1.1, 7.5.2.1, and 7.5.3.1

##### Section 7.5.1.1

1. Use what you’ve learned to improve the visualisation of the departure times of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights.

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# original visualization from section 7.4: 
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  mutate(
    cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,
    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60
  ) -> dat_7.4
dat_7.4 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(sched_dep_time)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = cancelled), binwidth = 1/4)
```

2. What variable in the diamonds dataset is most important for predicting the price of a diamond? How is that variable correlated with cut? Why does the combination of those two relationships lead to lower quality diamonds being more expensive?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# i'm thinking carat is most important for price

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 0.1)

# how is carat correlated with cut? 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = cut, y = carat))

# look at the combination of carat and cut
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 0.1) + 
  facet_wrap(~cut)
# lower quality diamonds (cut = fair) can be very large (>4 carat), making them most expensive
```

##### Section 7.5.2.1

1. How could you rescale the count dataset above to more clearly show the distribution of cut within colour, or colour within cut?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# count dataset 
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>% 
  glimpse()

# using group_by 
# dist of cut within colour 
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>% 
  group_by(color) %>% 
  mutate(perc = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  glimpse()

# dist of color within cut 
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  arrange(cut, color) %>% 
  mutate(perc = n / sum(n))
```

2. Use `geom_tile()` together with dplyr to explore how average flight delays vary by destination and month of year. What makes the plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest, month) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(aes(x = month, y = dest, fill = mean_dep_delay))


# idea: group the destinations by time zone
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest, month) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>% 
  left_join(airports, 
            by = c("dest" = "faa")) -> by_tzone 

by_tzone %>%  
  ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(aes(x = month, y = dest, fill = mean_dep_delay)) + 
  facet_wrap(~tzone, scales = "free_y")
  
# ok, a bit tricky still. only look at chi, la, ny 

by_tzone %>% 
  filter(tzone %in% c("America/Chicago", "America/Los_Angeles", "America/New_York")) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(aes(x = month, y = dest, fill = mean_dep_delay), color = "black", size = .1) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(tzone), scales = "free_y", space = "free_y") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = 1:12, expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "green", mid = "white", high = "red") 

```

##### Section 7.5.3.1

1. Instead of summarising the conditional distribution with a boxplot, you could use a frequency polygon. What do you need to consider when using `cut_width()` vs `cut_number()`? How does that impact a visualisation of the 2d distribution of `carat` and `price`?

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
# visualization using boxplots 
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20)))

# visualization with frequency polygon
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes( x= price, 
                     color = cut_number(carat, 5)))

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes( x= price, 
                     color = cut_width(carat, width = 1, boundary = 0)))
```

2. Visualise the distribution of carat, partitioned by price.

> Sam's Solution:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  mutate(price_bin = cut_number(price, n = 10)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price_bin)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

diamonds %>% 
  mutate(price_bin = cut_width(price, width = 2000, boundary = 0)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price_bin)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Open discussion 

What is `%>%`? 

- "Pipe operator" 
- takes an object on the left of `%>%` and makes it the first argument of the function on the right of the `%>%`
- makes code more human-readable: x %>% g(y) %>% h() vs. h(g(x,y))
- "Take x, and do g to it, then take the output from g and do h to it"
