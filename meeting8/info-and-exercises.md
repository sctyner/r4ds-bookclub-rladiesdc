-   Chapter 27: Section 27.2.1 \# 2
-   Chapter 27: Section 27.3.1 \# 2
-   Chapter 27: Section 27.4.7 \# 1
-   Chapter 28: Section 28.2.1 \# 3 or \# 2
-   Chapter 28: Section 28.3.1 \# 3
-   Chapter 28: Section 28.4.4 \# 3

Exercises are reproduced below.

### Chapter 27 Exercises

#### Section 27.2.1 \# 2

2.  Create a new R Markdown document with *File &gt; New File &gt; R
    Markdown…* Knit it by clicking the appropriate button. Knit it by
    using the appropriate keyboard short cut. Verify that you can modify
    the input and see the output update.

#### Section 27.3.1 \# 2

2.  Using the R Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:

-   Add a footnote.
-   Add a horizontal rule.
-   Add a block quote.

#### Section 27.4.7 \# 1

1.  Add a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, colour,
    and clarity. Assume you’re writing a report for someone who doesn’t
    know R, and instead of setting `echo = FALSE` on each chunk, set a
    global option.

### Chapter 28 Exercises

#### Section 28.2.1 \# 3 or \# 2

2\. The `geom_smooth()` is somewhat misleading because the hwy for large
engines is skewed upwards due to the inclusion of lightweight sports
cars with big engines. Use your modelling tools to fit and display a
better model.

3\. Take an exploratory graphic that you’ve created in the last month,
and add informative titles to make it easier for others to understand.

#### Section 28.3.1 \# 3

3.  How do labels with `geom_text()` interact with faceting? How can you
    add a label to a single facet? How can you put a different label in
    each facet? (Hint: think about the underlying data.)

#### Section 28.4.4 \# 3

3.  Change the display of the presidential terms by:

-   Combining the two variants shown above.
-   Improving the display of the y axis.
-   Labelling each term with the name of the president.
-   Adding informative plot labels.
-   Placing breaks every 4 years (this is trickier than it seems!).
